I regularly write about topics in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Some of these posts are my personal reference notes, which, I hope would also be useful to others. Whenever applicable I also provide [code](https://github.com/mikhailiuk/medium) in the form of jupyter notebooks. To receive regular updates follow me on [Medium](https://mikhailiuk.medium.com).
