Throughout my professional career I have on numerous occations been convinced in the importance of mentorship. A mentor is a person who can help with finding the right career path, 
blind spots that hold someone back, a plan forward and a way out from challenging situations. Mentorship also involves regular check ins to confirm that the plan is on track and provides
accountability. 

While mentorship assumes long term relationships, occasional career advice can also be valuable when things seem to be moving too slow. 

Wanting to give back to the tech community I have started mentoring, providing career advice and interview help on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/aliaksei-mikhailiuk">ADP List</a> where you can schedule a call with me.
